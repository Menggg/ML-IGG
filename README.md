prediction_noBase_relationship_RF_EUR_miss_degree3.R 
```

These three R scripts were written for the forward feature selection in relationship type within same relationship degree using Random Forest algorithm, which based on the relationship degree prediction results, and was called "hierarchical classification" in the manuscript.
